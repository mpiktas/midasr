midasr 0.2
============
A bug fix release

* Fix a bug, where the midas_r_ic_table would not work with formula containing only one term

* More explicit error messages are displayed when optimisation fails or when robust covariance matrix cannot be calculated

* Add progress indicator to average_forecast function

* Fix a bug in data_to_list function, make forecast.midas_r work with midas_u objects.

* Fix a bug in average_forecast, rolling samples were turning to recursive ones. 


midasr 0.1
============
Release to CRAN.


midasr 0.0.8
============

* Milestone release. 

* Support for the lagged dependent variable. 

* Support for the forecasting and forecast combinations. 

* Support for the model selection based on the information criteria

* First version of the user guide


midasr 0.0.6
============

* Milestone release. Full-fledged support for fitting MIDAS regressions without lagged dependent variable. 

* Robust and non-robust tests for MIDAS restriction. 

* The fitted model object has methods for generic functions `coef`, `deviance`, `fitted`, `residuals`, `predict`, `print`, `residuals`, `summary` and `vcov`. Additionally it has method `logLik` for use with `AIC` and `BIC` and methods `estfun` and `bread` for use with `vcovHAC` from package sandwich, i.e. there is support for computing robust standard errors for the coefficients

* Three demos illustrating the use of the package. They reproduce the results from the article "The statistical content and empirical testing of the MIDAS restrictions". 

midasr 0.0.2
============

* Support for exogenous variables. Supply using `exo` parameter.

* Option for using numerical gradients. New dependency on package numDeriv. 


midasr 0.0.1
============

* Initial release. Very basic functionality. Currently only one predictor variable
  is allowed. Full functionality of the package is reflected in help page of
  function hAh.test.
